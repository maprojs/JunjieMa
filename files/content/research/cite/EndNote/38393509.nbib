AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct a risk prediction model for assisted diagnosis of 
      Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) using machine learning algorithms, and to validate it 
      internally and externally. METHODS: Firstly, the data was cleaned and enhanced, 
      and was divided into training and test sets according to the 7:3 ratio. Then, the 
      metrics related to DN were filtered by difference analysis, Least Absolute 
      Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), 
      and Max-relevance and Min-redundancy (MRMR) algorithms. Ten machine learning 
      models were constructed based on the key variables. The best model was filtered 
      by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), Precision-Recall (PR), Accuracy, 
      Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Kappa, and was internally and 
      externally validated. Based on the best model, an online platform had been 
      constructed. RESULTS: 15 key variables were selected, and among the 10 machine 
      learning models, the Random Forest model achieved the best predictive 
      performance. In the test set, the area under the ROC curve was 0.912, and in two 
      external validation cohorts, the area under the ROC curve was 0.828 and 0.863, 
      indicating excellent predictive and generalization abilities. CONCLUSION: The 
      model has a good predictive value and is expected to help in the early diagnosis 
      and screening of clinical DN.
